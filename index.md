### News
I am recruiting highly motivated graduate students (MS/PhD programs) with strong research interests in the following topics:

* Compute-efficient deep learning training and inference algorithms (Quantization and Pruning)
* High performance and low power neural processor architecture design and implementation
* Deep learning performance analysis and dataflow/data-reuse optimization software
* Robust deep learning algorithms for in-memory computing (ReRAM and PCRAM)

** Full tuition (+ stipend) support is available for students who apply for the MS-PhD integrated program. **

Please contact me with your CV/Resume if interested!
